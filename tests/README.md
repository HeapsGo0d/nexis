# Nexis Test Suite

This directory contains the test suite for the Nexis project, designed to validate the production-hardened implementation and ensure real-world reliability.

## Real-World Implementation Notes

This testing suite validates a production-hardened implementation that addresses real-world challenges encountered during development:

### Build Challenges Addressed

- **CUDA Runtime Libraries**: The `nvidia/cuda:12.8.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu24.04` base image was missing `libcusparseLt.so.0` that PyTorch 2.7.1+cu128 expects. Solution: Let PyTorch wheels bring their own CUDA libraries.

- **CI/CD Compatibility**: Build hosts without NVIDIA drivers caused `torch.cuda` calls to fail during build. Solution: Conditional CUDA validation with `SKIP_CUDA_CHECK` environment variable.

- **Virtual Environment Issues**: Runtime stage missing `/usr/lib/python3.11` caused `ModuleNotFoundError` for standard library. Solution: Self-contained venv with `--copies` flag and explicit standard library copying.

- **Script Compatibility**: Windows CRLF line endings made scripts non-executable. Solution: `sed -i 's/\r$//' + chmod +x` in Dockerfile.

### Production Patterns Implemented

- **Enhanced Signal Handling**: Proper SIGTERM/SIGINT forwarding to service manager
- **Structured Logging**: ISO 8601 timestamps with consistent log format
- **Health Monitoring**: Docker health checks with proper startup periods
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup on container shutdown

## Test Scripts

### Docker Build Test (`test_docker_build.sh`)

**Purpose**: Validates the production-hardened multi-stage build process

**What it tests**:
- **Build Stage (CPU Compatible)**: Tests that build stage completes on CPU-only hosts
- **PyTorch Installation**: Validates PyTorch 2.7.1+cu128 with self-contained CUDA libraries
- **Virtual Environment**: Tests self-contained venv with `--copies` and standard library access
- **Production Stage**: Validates runtime stage with proper library copying
- **Script Compatibility**: Tests CRLF line ending fixes and executable permissions
- **Dependency Validation**: Tests enhanced validation script with CUDA skip logic

**Build Stages Tested**:
1. **Build stage**: CPU-compatible build with PyTorch and dependencies
2. **Production stage**: Runtime-optimized stage with copied venv and libraries

**Expected duration**: 8-20 minutes (depending on build cache and network)

### Service Startup Test (`test_service_startup.sh`)

**Purpose**: Validates the production-hardened service management and entrypoint logic.

**What it tests**:
- **Service Environment**: Ensures services use the correct Python from the virtual environment.
- **CUDA Check Skipping**: Verifies that `SKIP_CUDA_CHECK` works as expected on hosts without NVIDIA drivers.
- **Docker Health Check**: Tests the container's health check mechanism.
- **Service Recovery**: Validates that the service manager can restart a failed service.
- **Structured Logging**: Checks for the presence of enhanced, structured log output.
- **Signal Handling**: Tests graceful shutdown and signal forwarding.

### End-to-End Test (`test_end_to_end.sh`)

**Purpose**: Simulates a full production workflow from build to shutdown.

**What it tests**:
- **Production Build**: Full multi-stage build process.
- **Container Startup**: Production-like container startup with various environment variables.
- **Startup Monitoring**: Monitors for structured logging and successful dependency validation.
- **Virtual Environment**: Validates the venv in a running production container.
- **Service Health**: Checks that all services (ComfyUI, Filebrowser) are running and responsive.
- **Content Downloads**: Verifies that models and other assets are downloaded correctly.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Tests the full shutdown sequence with signal handling.

## How to Run Tests

### System Requirements

#### For CI/CD (Build Testing)
- **CPU-only builds supported**: Tests can run on hosts without NVIDIA drivers
- **Docker BuildKit**: Required for multi-stage builds and cache mounts
- **Memory**: 4GB+ RAM for build process
- **Storage**: 15GB+ free space for build layers and test downloads

#### For Runtime Testing
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.8+ support (for full validation)
- **NVIDIA Container Runtime**: For GPU access in containers
- **Memory**: 8GB+ RAM recommended for model loading
- **Storage**: 20GB+ free space for models and test data

### Running All Tests

A convenience script `run_all_tests.sh` can be created to execute the entire suite in order.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
echo "Running Docker Build Test..."
./tests/test_docker_build.sh
echo "Running Service Startup Test..."
./tests/test_service_startup.sh
echo "Running End-to-End Test..."
./tests/test_end_to_end.sh
echo "All tests passed!"
```

Make it executable (`chmod +x run_all_tests.sh`) and run it from the project root.

## CI/CD Integration

The test suite is designed for production CI/CD pipelines with real-world constraints:

### CPU-Only Build Support

Tests can run on CPU-only CI hosts (like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI):

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: Nexis CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
      - name: Test Docker Build (CPU-only)
        run: |
          export SKIP_CUDA_CHECK=1
          ./tests/test_docker_build.sh

  gpu-test:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, gpu]
    needs: build-test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Full Test Suite
        run: ./tests/run_all_tests.sh
```

### Environment Variables for CI

- `SKIP_CUDA_CHECK=1`: Skip GPU validation during build (for CPU-only hosts)
- `DEBUG_MODE=true`: Enable detailed logging for CI debugging
- `CI=true`: Adjust timeouts and behavior for CI environments

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Build fails with "libcusparseLt.so.0 not found"**:
- This is expected on the old approach. The current implementation lets PyTorch wheels provide CUDA libraries.
- Ensure you're using the updated Dockerfile with self-contained PyTorch installation.

**"RuntimeError: No CUDA driver" during build**:
- Set `SKIP_CUDA_CHECK=1` for CPU-only build hosts
- The production implementation automatically detects driver availability

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'"**:
- This indicates missing Python standard library in runtime stage
- Ensure the Dockerfile copies `/usr/lib/python3.11` to production stage

**Scripts not executable or "bad interpreter"**:
- Check for Windows CRLF line endings: `file script.sh`
- The Dockerfile should include: `sed -i 's/\r$//' script.sh && chmod +x script.sh`

**Services fail to start with signal handling errors**:
- Verify the enhanced entrypoint.sh with proper signal forwarding
- Check that SERVICE_MANAGER_PID is properly tracked

**Virtual environment not found**:
- Ensure VIRTUAL_ENV and PATH are set correctly in production stage
- Verify the venv was created with `--copies` flag for relocatability

## Performance Benchmarks
